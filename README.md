# Additional Features

- Added a **delete button** to delete a particular task from both the todo list and completed task list
- A **Reset Filter button** to clear the hashtags filter.

# List of Assumptions

- An empty string is not allowed.
- Pre-defined hashtags, which are commonly used in day-to-day life.

# Unhandled edge cases

-  Assuming that the user is entering a valid string in the todo list.
-  A substring of a word matching the hashtag will be changed with the (#) infront of it.
-  Example: Classtest will be converted to Class#test


# Working
